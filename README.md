They share a common gift watch with each other on their birthday. However, Rishi witnesses Radha being harassed by their classmate Rakesh and warns Radha to avoid him. While Radha abides by Rishi's words, Rakesh hatches a plan to trick her into talking to him. This invokes Rishi's fury, and he starts beating up Rakesh, which prompts Radha to slap Rishi, who slaps her in return. With this event, they both vow that they will not talk to each other until one of them first breaks the silence.

On the other hand, their families get close to each other and share the same neighborhood. Radha has an elder sister Subha and an elder brother Arjun Prasad. Arjun is an aspiring politician for Samaja Seva Party. The party has a youth leader Rana, who uses the influence of his father to become youth president when his plans are thwarted by Arjun, who exposes his drug scam. Now, the entire family of Rishi and Radha plan to go for Tirupathi leaving the pair. While Radha prepares for her studies at her friend's home. Rishi arrives to distract her with loud music. So, Radha decides to leave her home when she gets caught by Rana. While Rana and his associates try to molest her, Rishi arrives to save her, and Radha kisses him passionately, breaking the silence between the two and uniting them.

Meanwhile, Arjun's friend Siva arrives from the US and is the son of the Minister. Arjun decides to give the hand of his elder sister to his friend, while his sister reveals she is in love with Rishi's brother. This infuriates the minister, who publicly demeans Arjun. Losing his prestige in the colony, Arjun picks a fight with Rishi's family and orders his family members to stay away from them.

Radha and Rishi attend a medical camp. Radha is assigned to a guardian, the village sarpanch.

While Rishi carries the kid to the hospital, Arjun gives some money to the mother for hospital expenses.

However, Rana utilizes this as an opportunity to show the party committee members that Arjun bribed the public for a vote and used his family to rig the elections. While the committee plans to take action against Arjun, the minister arrives and shows the bribe is a made-up story by Rana and saves Arjun. Now Arjun rushes home, however on the way Rishi and Radha confront him together and show him that their families have united, and he is all alone.
